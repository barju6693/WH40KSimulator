# CHARGE PHASE 
Warriors hurl themselves into battle to slay with blade, hammer and claw. Strident war cries and frantic 
screams echo through the whirling smoke as the moment of cataclysmic violence draws near. 

Use the following sequence to charge with your units.
1. SELECT ELIGIBLE UNIT
2. SELECT TARGETS
3. MAKE CHARGE ROLL
4. MAKE CHARGE MOVE
5. REPEAT FOR NEXT ELIGIBLE UNIT

## CHARGE BONUS
Many warriors thunder headlong 
into combat, using the impetus of 
their charge to bring swift death to 
their foes.
Each time a unit makes a Charge 
move, until the end of the turn, 
that unit has the Fights First 
ability (pg 32)

___

In your Charge phase, if you have any eligible units from your 
army on the battlefield that you want to charge into close 
combat, you can select those units, one at a time, to declare 
a charge. Each can only be selected once per phase. Once all 
of these charges (if any) have been resolved, progress to the 
Fight phase. 

A unit is eligible to charge if it is within 12" of one or more 
enemy units at the start of your Charge phase, unless any of the 
following apply:
* That unit Advanced or Fell Back this turn.
* That unit is within Engagement Range of any enemy models.
* That unit is an Aircraft unit.

## CHARGING WITH A UNIT
Once you have selected an eligible unit to declare a charge, you 
must select one or more enemy units within 12" of it as the 
targets of that charge. The targets of a charge do not need to be 
visible to the charging unit. 

You then make a Charge roll for the charging unit by rolling 
2D6. The result is the maximum number of inches each model 
in that unit can be moved if a Charge move is possible. For a 
Charge move to be possible, the Charge roll must be sufficient to 
enable the charging unit to end that move:
* Within Engagement Range of every unit that you selected as a 
target of the charge.
* Without moving within Engagement Range of any enemy 
units that were not a target of the charge.
* In Unit Coherency.

If any of these conditions cannot be met, the charge fails and 
no models in the charging unit move this phase. Otherwise, the 
charge is successful and the models in the charging unit make 
a Charge move – move each model a distance in inches up to 
the result of the Charge roll. When doing so, each model in the 
charging unit must end its Charge move closer to one of the 
units selected as a target of its charge. If you can also move a 
charging model so that it ends its Charge move in base-to-base 
contact with one or more enemy models while still enabling the 
charging unit to end its move satisfying all of the conditions 
above, you must do so. The controlling player chooses the order 
in which to move their models.

* Charge Roll: 2D6".
* Targets of a charge must be within 12" but do not need to be visible.
* If the distance rolled is insufficient to move within Engagement 
Range of all targets while maintaining Unit Coherency, the 
charge fails.
* Cannot move within Engagement Range of any unit that was not a 
target of the charge.
* If the charge is successful, each model makes a Charge move less 
than or equal to the Charge roll, and must move into base-to-base 
contact with an enemy model if possible.

## CHARGING OVER TERRAIN
Unless otherwise stated, a model can be moved 
over a terrain feature when it makes a Charge 
move, but not through it.

A model can be moved over terrain features that 
are 2" or less in height as if they were not there. A 
model can be moved vertically in order to climb 
up, down and over any terrain features that are 
taller than this, counting the vertical distance up 
and/or down as part of its Charge move. Models 
cannot end a Charge move mid-climb – if it is not 
possible to make a Charge move as a result, the 
charge fails.
* Models can be moved freely over terrain 
features 2" or less in height.
* Models cannot move through terrain 
features taller than 2", but can climb up and 
down them.

## CHARGING WITH FLYING MODELS
When a model that can Fly starts or ends a Charge 
move on a terrain feature, instead of measuring 
the path it has moved across the battlefield, you 
instead measure its path ‘through the air’. In 
addition, it can be moved over other models as if 
they were not there. A model that can Fly cannot 
end any move on top of another model.
* Fly models can move over other models 
when they make a Charge move.
* Fly models that start or end a Charge move 
on a terrain feature measure distance 
moved through the air when they make a 
Charge move.
