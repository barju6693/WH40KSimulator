# DEPLOYMENT ABILITIES
Some abilities are used during deployment, or when setting a unit up – either on the battlefield or into Reserves. These are known as Deployment abilities, and some widespread examples of these are presented below.

## DEEP STRIKE
Some units make their way to battle via tunnelling, 
teleportation, high-altitude descent or other 
extraordinary means that allow them to appear 
suddenly in the thick of the fighting.

During the Declare Battle Formations step, if every 
model in a unit has this ability, you can set it up in 
Reserves instead of setting it up on the battlefield. 
If you do, in the Reinforcements step of one of your 
Movement phases you can set up this unit anywhere 
on the battlefield that is more than 9" horizontally 
away from all enemy models.
* Unit can be set up in Reserves instead of on 
the battlefield.
* Unit can be set up in your Reinforcements 
step, more than 9" horizontally away from all 
enemy models.

## SCOUTS
Scouts form the vanguard of many armies. Unnoticed 
by the enemy, they range ahead of the main force.

Some units have ‘Scouts x"’ listed in their abilities. 
If every model in a unit has this ability, then at 
the start of the first battle round, before the first 
turn begins, it can make a Normal move of up to 
x" as if it were your Movement phase – as can any 
Dedicated Transport model such a unit starts the 
battle embarked within (provided only models with 
this ability are embarked within that Dedicated 
Transport model). A unit that moves using this 
ability must end that move more than 9" horizontally 
away from all enemy models. If both players have 
units that can do this, the player who is taking the 
first turn moves their units first.

_Example: A unit has the Scouts 6" ability. At the 
start of the first battle round, the controlling player 
can make a Normal move with that unit of up to 6"._

* Scouts x": Unit can make a Normal move of up 
to x" before the first turn begins.
* If embarked in a Dedicated Transport, 
that Dedicated Transport can make this 
move instead.
* Must end this move more than 9" horizontally 
away from all enemy models.

## INFILTRATORS
Many armies employ reconnaissance units who can sit 
concealed, waiting for the right moment to strike.
During deployment, if every model in a unit has 
this ability, then when you set it up, it can be set 
up anywhere on the battlefield that is more than 9" 
horizontally away from the enemy deployment zone 
and all enemy models.

## LEADER
Mighty heroes fight at the forefront of battle.
Some Character units have ‘Leader’ listed on their 
datasheets. Such Character units are known as 
Leaders, and the units they can lead – known as their 
Bodyguard units – are listed on their datasheet.
During the Declare Battle Formations step, for each 
Leader in your army, if your army also includes one 
or more of that Leader’s Bodyguard units, you can 
select one of those Bodyguard units. That Leader will 
then attach to that Bodyguard unit for the duration 
of the battle and is said to be leading that unit. Each 
Bodyguard unit can only have one Leader attached 
to it.

While a Bodyguard unit contains a Leader, it is 
known as an Attached unit and, with the exception 
of rules that are triggered when units are destroyed 
(pg 12), it is treated as a single unit for all rules 
purposes. Each time an attack targets an Attached 
unit, until the attacking unit has resolved all of its 
attacks, you must use the Toughness characteristic of 
the Bodyguard models in that unit, even if a Leader 
in that unit has a different Toughness characteristic. 
Each time an attack sucessfully wounds an Attached 
unit, that attack cannot be allocated to a Character
model in that unit, even if that Character model 
has lost one or more wounds or has already had 
attacks allocated to it this phase. As soon as the last 
Bodyguard model in an Attached unit has been 
destroyed, any attacks made against that unit that 
have yet to be allocated can then be allocated to 
Character models in that unit. 

* Before the battle, Character units with the 
Leader ability can be attached to one of their 
Bodyguard units to form an Attached unit.
* Attached units can only contain one Leader.
* Attacks cannot be allocated to Character
models in Attached units
