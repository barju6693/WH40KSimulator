# WEAPON ABILITIES
Some weapons have additional abilities in their profiles. Often these are unique to those weapons and 
are written out in full, but others are common to many weapons, and may only be referenced by name 
on a weapon’s profile. Some notable examples of these common abilities are defined here; further 
weapon abilities may be found in other locations such as Codexes.

## ASSAULT
Assault weapons fire so indiscriminately that they can 
be shot from the hip as warriors dash forward.
Weapons with [ASSAULT] in their profile are known as 
Assault weapons. If a unit that Advanced this turn 
contains any models equipped with Assault weapons, 
it is still eligible to shoot in this turn’s Shooting 
phase. When such a unit is selected to shoot, you 
can only resolve attacks using Assault weapons its 
models are equipped with. 
* Can be shot even if the bearer’s unit Advanced.

## RAPID FIRE
Rapid fire weapons are capable of long-ranged 
precision shots or controlled bursts at nearby targets.
Weapons with [RAPID FIRE X] in their profile are known 
as Rapid Fire weapons. Each time such a weapon 
targets a unit within half that weapon’s range, the 
Attacks characteristic of that weapon is increased by 
the amount denoted by ‘x’. 

_Example: A model targets a unit that is within half 
range of a weapon with an Attacks characteristic 
of 1 and the [RAPID FIRE 1] ability. That weapon 
therefore makes two attacks at the target, and you 
make two Hit rolls._
* [RAPID FIRE X]: Increase the Attacks by ‘x’ when 
targeting units within half range.

## IGNORES COVER
Some weapons are designed to root enemy formations 
out of entrenched positions.
Weapons with [IGNORES COVER] in their profile are 
known as Ignores Cover weapons. Each time an 
attack is made with such a weapon, the target cannot 
have the Benefit of Cover against that attack (pg 44).

## TWIN-LINKED
Dual weapons are often grafted to the same targeting 
system for greater lethality.
Weapons with [TWIN-LINKED] in their profile are known 
as Twin-linked weapons. Each time an attack is 
made with such a weapon, you can re-roll that 
attack’s Wound roll.

## PISTOL
Pistols can be wielded even at point-blank range.

Weapons with [PISTOL] in their profile are known as 
Pistols. If a unit contains any models equipped with 
Pistols, that unit is eligible to shoot in its controlling 
player’s Shooting phase even while it is within 
Engagement Range of one or more enemy units. 
When such a unit is selected to shoot, it can only 
resolve attacks using its Pistols and can only target 
one of the enemy units it is within Engagement 
Range of. In such circumstances, a Pistol can target 
an enemy unit even if other friendly units are within 
Engagement Range of the same enemy unit. 

If a model is equipped with one or more Pistols, 
unless it is a Monster or Vehicle model, it can either 
shoot with its Pistols or with all of its other ranged 
weapons. Declare whether such a model will shoot 
with its Pistols or its other ranged weapons before 
selecting targets.

* Can be shot even if the bearer’s unit is within 
Engagement Range of enemy units, but must 
target one of those enemy units.
* Cannot be shot alongside any other non-Pistol 
weapon (except by a Monster or Vehicle).

## TORRENT
Torrent weapons shoot clouds of fire, gas or other 
lethal substances that few foes can hope to evade.
Weapons with [TORRENT] in their profile are known 
as Torrent weapons. Each time an attack is made 
with such a weapon, that attack automatically hits 
the target.

## LETHAL HITS
Some weapons can inflict fatal injuries on any foe, no 
matter their resilience.
Weapons with [LETHAL HITS] in their profile are known 
as Lethal Hits weapons. Each time an attack is made 
with such a weapon, a Critical Hit automatically 
wounds the target.

## LANCE
Lance weapons are deadly on the charge.
Weapons with [LANCE] in their profile are known as 
Lance weapons. Each time an attack is made with 
such a weapon, if the bearer made a Charge move 
this turn, add 1 to that attack’s Wound roll.

## INDIRECT FIRE
Indirect fire weapons launch munitions over or around 
intervening obstacles – nowhere is safe from their fury.
Weapons with [INDIRECT FIRE] in their profile are 
known as Indirect Fire weapons, and attacks can be 
made with them even if the target is not visible to the 
attacking model. These attacks can destroy enemy 
models in a target unit even though none may have 
been visible to the attacking unit when you selected 
that target.

If no models in a target unit are visible to the 
attacking unit when you select that target, then each 
time a model in the attacking unit makes an attack 
against that target using an Indirect Fire weapon, 
subtract 1 from that attack’s Hit roll and the target 
has the Benefit of Cover against that attack (pg 44). 

_Example: An enemy unit is targeted by an 
attacking model equipped with a weapon with the 
[INDIRECT FIRE] ability. No models in the target unit 
are visible to the attacking model, so when resolving 
the attacks made with that weapon, subtract 1 
from that attack’s Hit roll and each time an attack 
is allocated to a model in the target unit, it has the 
Benefit of Cover against that attack._

* Can target and make attacks against units that 
are not visible to the attacking unit.
* If no models are visible in a target unit when 
it is selected, then when making an attack 
against that target with an Indirect Fire 
weapon, subtract 1 from that attack’s Hit roll 
and the target has the Benefit of Cover against 
that attack.

## PRECISION

Precision attacks can pick high-value targets out in a 
crowd, whether through the unerring aim of a sniper 
or the pinpoint accuracy of a blade-master’s strike. 
Weapons with [PRECISION] in their profile are known 
as Precision weapons. Each time an attack made with 
such a weapon successfully wounds an Attached unit 
(pg 39), if a Character model in that unit is visible 
to the attacking model, the attacking model’s player 
can choose to have that attack allocated to that 
Character model instead of following the normal 
attack sequence.

* When targeting an Attached unit, the attacking 
model’s player can have the attack allocated 
to a Character model in that unit visible to 
the bearer.

## BLAST 
High-explosives can fell several warriors in a single 
blast, but firing them where your comrades will get 
caught in the ensuing detonation is simply unwise.

Weapons with [BLAST] in their profile are known as 
Blast weapons, and they make a random number of 
attacks. Each time you determine how many attacks 
are made with a Blast weapon, add 1 to the result for 
every five models that were in the target unit when 
you selected it as the target (rounding down). Blast 
weapons can never be used to make attacks against a 
unit that is within Engagement Range of one or more 
units from the attacking model’s army (including its 
own unit). 

_Example: If a weapon with the [BLAST] ability and 
an Attacks characteristic of 2D6 targets a unit that 
contains 11 models, and the roll to determine how 
many attacks are made is a 9, a total of 11 attacks 
would be made against that unit._

* Add 1 to the Attacks characteristic for every 
five models in the target unit (rounding down).
* Can never be used against a target that is 
within Engagement Range of any units from the 
attacking model’s army (including its own).

## MELTA
Melta weapons are powerful heat rays whose fury is 
magnified at close range.
Weapons with [MELTA X] in their profile are known 
as Melta weapons. Each time an attack made 
with such a weapon targets a unit within half that 
weapon’s range, that attack’s Damage characteristic is 
increased by the amount denoted by ‘x’. 

_Example: A model targets a unit that is within half 
range of a weapon with a Damage characteristic 
of D6 and the [MELTA 2] ability. If that attack inflicts 
damage on the target, it inflicts D6+2 damage._

* [MELTA X]: Increase the Damage by ‘x’ when 
targeting units within half range.


## HEAVY
Heavy weapons are amongst the biggest guns on the 
battlefield, but require bracing to fire at full effect and 
are unwieldy to bring to bear at close quarters. 

Weapons with [HEAVY] in their profile are known 
as Heavy weapons. Each time an attack is made 
with such a weapon, if the attacking model’s unit 
Remained Stationary this turn, add 1 to that attack’s 
Hit roll.

* Add 1 to Hit rolls if the bearer’s unit Remained 
Stationary this turn.

## HAZARDOUS
Weapons powered by unstable and dangerous energy 
sources pose a substantial risk to the wielder every 
time they are used. 

Weapons with [HAZARDOUS] in their profile are known 
as Hazardous weapons. Each time a unit is selected 
to shoot or fight, if one or more models attack with 
Hazardous weapons, then after that unit has resolved 
all of its attacks, you must take one Hazardous 
test for each Hazardous weapon that was just used 
by rolling one D6. For each roll of 1, that test is 
failed and one model in that unit equipped with 
a Hazardous weapon is destroyed (selected by the 
controlling player), unless that model is a Character, 
Monster or Vehicle, in which case it suffers 3 
mortal wounds instead. Note that if you selected a 
Character model in an Attached unit, the mortal 
wounds suffered must be allocated to that model 
first, even if there is another model in that unit that 
has lost one or more wounds or has had attacks 
allocated to it this phase. 

_Example: A unit of five models make five attacks 
with ranged weapons with the [HAZARDOUS] ability. 
After the unit has finished shooting, its controlling 
player rolls five D6. One of the results is a 1, and as 
no models in the unit are Characters, Monsters or 
Vehicles, one of those models is destroyed._

* After a unit shoots or fights, roll one Hazardous 
test (one D6) for each Hazardous weapon 
used. For each 1, one model equipped with a 
Hazardous weapon is destroyed (Characters, 
Monsters and Vehicles suffer 3 mortal 
wounds instead). 

## DEVASTATING WOUNDS
Some weapons can inflict strikes of such power that 
they make a mockery of armour and can cleave 
through several foes. 

Weapons with [DEVASTATING WOUNDS] in their profile 
are known as Devastating Wounds weapons. Each 
time an attack is made with such a weapon, a Critical 
Wound inflicts a number of mortal wounds on the 
target equal to the Damage characteristic of that 
weapon and the attack sequence ends.

_Example: An attack made with a Devastating 
Wounds weapon with a Damage characteristic of 
2 scores a Critical Wound. Instead of allocating 
the attack and making saving throws normally, the 
target suffers 2 mortal wounds._

* A Critical Wound inflicts mortal wounds equal to 
the weapon’s Damage characteristic, instead of 
any normal damage.

## SUSTAINED HITS
Some weapons strike in a flurry of blows, tearing the 
foe apart with relentless ferocity. 

Weapons with [SUSTAINED HITS X] in their profile are 
known as Sustained Hits weapons. Each time an 
attack is made with such a weapon, if a Critical Hit is 
rolled, that attack scores a number of additional hits 
on the target as denoted by ‘x’. 

_Example: A model makes an attack with a melee 
weapon with the [SUSTAINED HITS 2] ability. If the 
Hit roll is an unmodified 6 (a Critical Hit), then 
that attack scores a total of 3 hits on the target (1 
from the successful Hit roll of 6, and 2 from the 
[SUSTAINED HITS 2] ability)._

* [SUSTAINED HITS X]: Each Critical Hit scores ‘x’ 
additional hits on the target.

## EXTRA ATTACKS
Some warriors ride to battle atop trusty mounts that 
gore and trample nearby foes. Others wield combat 
weapons that deliver a frenzy of additional blows. 

Weapons with [EXTRA ATTACKS] in their profile are 
known as Extra Attacks weapons. Each time the 
bearer of such a weapon fights, it can make attacks 
with that weapon in addition to the one it chooses 
to fight with. The number of attacks made with 
an Extra Attacks weapon cannot be modified by 
other rules. 
* The bearer can attack with this weapon in 
addition to any other weapons it can make 
attacks with.

##ANTI
Certain weapons are the bane of a particular foe.

Weapons with [ANTI-KEYWORD X+] in their profile are 
known as Anti weapons. Each time an attack is 
made with such a weapon against a target with 
the keyword after the word ‘Anti-’, an unmodified 
Wound roll of ‘x+’ scores a Critical Wound. 

_Example: An attack made with an [ANTI-VEHICLE 4+]
weapon will score a Critical Wound against – and 
so successfully wound – a Vehicle unit on an 
unmodified Wound roll of 4+, while an attack made 
with an [ANTI-PSYKER 2+] weapon will score a Critical 
Wound against – and so successfully wound – a 
Psyker unit on an unmodified Wound roll of 2+._

* [ANTI-KEYWORD X+]: An unmodified Wound roll of 
‘x+’ against a target with the matching keyword 
scores a Critical Wound.
