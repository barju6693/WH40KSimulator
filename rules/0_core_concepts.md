# MISSIONS
To play a game of Warhammer 40,000, you must first select a
mission. The mission will tell you how to muster your armies,
create your battlefield and deploy your forces on the tabletop.
It will also tell you any special rules that apply to the battle, and
(most importantly!) what you need to do to win. You can find
out more about missions on pages 57-58.

# ARMIES
Each player in a game of Warhammer 40,000 commands an
army of Citadel miniatures, hereafter referred to as models. The
mission you have selected will guide you as to how big your
army should be.
* Army: All of the models under your command.

# UNITS
Models move and fight in units. A unit can have one or more
models from a single datasheet (see below). Models and units
from the same army are said to be friendly in relation to each
other. Models and units from your opponent’s army are referred
to as enemy models and units. If a rule affects ‘models’ or ‘units’
without specifying that they are friendly or enemy, that rule
affects all models or all units, regardless of whose army they
are in.
* Unit: One or more models from the same datasheet.
* Friendly Models/Units: All models/units from the
same army.
* Enemy Models/Units: All models/units from your
opponent’s army.

# DATASHEETS
The rules you will need to use your models in games are
presented on datasheets. Each unit has a datasheet;
you will need the datasheets for all the units
from your army. You can find out more about
datasheets on pages 37-38.

# KEYWORDS
All datasheets have a list of keywords, separated into Faction
keywords and other keywords. Faction keywords can be used
to help you decide which models to include in your army, but
otherwise both sets of keywords are functionally the same.
In either case, keywords appear in Keyword Bold. Keywords
are sometimes linked to (or ‘tagged’ by) a rule. For example, a
rule might say that it applies to Infantry units. This means it
only applies to units that have the Infantry keyword on their
datasheet. The pluralisation (or otherwise) of keywords does not
affect which units the rule in question applies to.

# UNIT COHERENCY
A unit that contains more than one model must be set
up and end any kind of move as a single group, with all
of its models within 2" horizontally and 5" vertically of
at least one other model from that unit. While a unit has
seven or more models, all of its models must instead be
set up and end any kind of move within 2" horizontally
and 5" vertically of at least two other models from that
unit. This is called Unit Coherency.
If for any reason a model cannot be set up in Unit
Coherency, that model is destroyed. If a unit cannot end
a move in Unit Coherency, it cannot make that move
and its models are returned to their previous positions.
At the end of every turn, each player must remove
models, one at a time, from any of the units from
their armies that are no longer in Unit Coherency,
until only a single group of models from each of those
units remains in play and in Unit Coherency. Models
removed in this way count as having been destroyed,
but they never trigger any rules that apply when a
model is destroyed.
* Unit Coherency: Within 2" horizontally and 5"
vertically of:
  * One other model from the same unit
  (in units of 2-6 models).
  * Two other models from the same unit
  (in units of 7+ models).
* At the end of every turn, if a unit is not in Unit
Coherency, the controlling player must remove
models until that unit is in Unit Coherency again.

# ENGAGEMENT RANGE
Engagement Range represents the zone of threat that models
present to their enemies. While a model is within 1" horizontally
and 5" vertically of an enemy model, those models – and their
units – are within Engagement Range of each other.
Models cannot be set up or end a Normal, Advance or Fall
Back move within Engagement Range of any enemy models. If
for any reason a model cannot meet this condition, that model
is destroyed.
* Engagement Range: Within 1" horizontally and
5" vertically.
* Models cannot be set up or end a Normal, Advance
or Fall Back move within Engagement Range of any
enemy models.

# BATTLEFIELD
Battles of Warhammer 40,000 are fought on rectangular
battlefields. This can be any surface upon which the models can
stand – a dining table, for example, or the floor. Your mission
will guide you as to the size of battlefield required.
TERRAIN FEATURES
The scenery on a battlefield can be represented by models from
the Warhammer 40,000 range. These models are called terrain
features to differentiate them from the models that make up an
army. Terrain features are set up on the battlefield before the
battle begins. You can find out more about terrain features on
pages 44-48.
Unless the mission you are playing instructs you otherwise, you
should feel free to create an exciting battlefield using any terrain
features from your collection.

# MEASURING DISTANCES
Distances in Warhammer 40,000 are measured in inches ("). You
can measure distances whenever you wish.
When measuring the distance between models, measure
between the closest points of the bases of the models you’re
measuring to and from. If a model does not have a base,
measure to the closest point of any part of that model instead.
If a rule says it applies ‘within’ a certain distance, it applies at
any distance that is not more than the specified distance. For
example, within 1" means any distance that is not more than
1" away.

# DETERMINING VISIBILITY
Warhammer 40,000 uses true line of sight to determine visibility between models. To check this, get a ‘model’s
perspective’ view by looking from behind the observing model. For the purposes of determining visibility, an
observing model can see through other models in its unit, and a model’s base is also part of that model.

## MODEL VISIBLE
If any part of another model can be
seen from any part of the observing
model, that other model is visible to
the observing model.

## UNIT VISIBLE
If one or more models in a unit is
visible to the observing model, then
that model’s unit is visible to the
observing model.

## MODEL FULLY VISIBLE
If every part of another model that
is facing the observing model can be
seen from any part of the observing
model, then that other model is said
to be fully visible to the observing
model, i.e. the observing model
has line of sight to all parts of the
other model that are facing it,
without any other models or terrain
features blocking visibility to any of
those parts.

## UNIT FULLY VISIBLE
If every model in a unit is fully
visible to an observing model,
then that unit is fully visible to that
observing model. For the purposes
of determining if an enemy unit is
fully visible, an observing model
can see through other models in the
unit it is observing.
* Model Visible: If any part
of a model can be seen, it
is visible.
* Unit Visible: If any model in
a unit is visible, that model’s
unit is visible.
* Model Fully Visible: If every
facing part of a model can be
seen, it is fully visible.
* Unit Fully Visible: If
every model in a unit is
fully visible, that unit is
fully visible.

# DICE
In order to fight a battle, you will require some six-sided
dice (often abbreviated to D6). Some rules refer to 2D6, 3D6
and so on – in such cases, roll that many D6 and add the
results together.
If a rule requires you to roll a D3, roll a D6 and halve the result
(rounding up to a whole number) to get the D3 result, as
shown below.

## ROLLING A D3
| DICE RESULT D3 RESULT | D3 RESULT |
|-----------------------|-----------|
| 1 or 2                | 1         |
| 3 or 4                | 2         |
| 5 or 6                | 3         |

If a rule requires a dice roll of, for example, 3 or more, this is
often abbreviated to 3+. Where several consecutive dice results
are relevant to a rule, these are often shown as a range (e.g. 1-3).

## RE-ROLLS
Some rules allow you to re-roll a dice roll, which means you get
to roll some or all of the dice again. If a rule allows you to re-roll
a dice roll that was made by adding several dice together (e.g.
2D6, 3D6, etc.) then, unless otherwise stated, you must re-roll
all of those dice again.
You can never re-roll a dice more than once, and re-rolls happen
before modifiers (if any) are applied. Rules that refer to the value
of an ‘unmodified’ dice roll are referring to the dice result after
any re-rolls, but before any modifiers are applied.
* Unmodified Dice: the result after re-rolls, but before
any modifiers.
* A dice can never be re-rolled more than once.
* You must re-roll all dice if several need adding together
(e.g. 2D6).
* Re-rolls are applied before any modifiers.

## ROLL-OFFS
Some rules instruct players to roll off. To do so, both players roll
one D6, and whoever scores highest wins the roll-off. If there is
a tie for the highest roll, roll off again. Neither player is allowed
to re-roll or modify any of the D6 when making a roll-off.

# SEQUENCING
While playing Warhammer 40,000, you’ll occasionally find that
two or more rules are to be resolved at the same time. If this
occurs during the battle, the player whose turn it is chooses the
order. If this occurs before or after the battle, or at the start or
end of a battle round, the players roll off and the winner decides
the order in which those rules are resolved.
