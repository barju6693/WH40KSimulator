# MOVEMENT PHASE

The ground shakes to the tread of marching feet and the growl of engines as armies advance across the 
battlefield and vie for advantageous positions.
 
Your Movement phase is split 
into two steps. First you can 
move your units, then you can set 
up reinforcements.

 MOVE UNITS
 2
 REINFORCEMENTS
 
# 1. MOVE UNITS
Start your Movement phase by selecting one unit from your 
army that is on the battlefield to move: 
* Unless that unit is within Engagement Range of any enemy 
models, it can make a Normal move, or Advance, or 
Remain Stationary. 
* If that unit is within Engagement Range of any enemy 
models, it can either Remain Stationary or Fall Back. 
After you have finished moving that unit, select another unit 
from your army to move, and so on, until you have done so 
with all of your units. Once you have moved all of your units, 
progress to the Reinforcements step of your Movement phase.

Each time you move a unit, you can move any of its models you 
choose to. The controlling player chooses the order in which to 
move their models. Whenever you move a model, you can pivot 
it and/or change its position on the battlefield along any path, 
but no part of its base can be moved across an enemy model or 
cross the edge of the battlefield. It can be moved over friendly 
models as if they were not there if you wish, but it cannot end 
its move on top of another model. The only exception to this is 
when moving **Monster** or **Vehicle** models; such models cannot 
be moved over other friendly **Monster** or **Vehicle** models and 
must be moved around them instead. The distance a model 
moves is measured using the part of its base that moves furthest 
along its path. If a model does not have a base, measure using 
whichever part of that model moves the furthest. 

*  When a unit moves it can make a Normal move, Advance or 
Remain Stationary.
* Units that are within Engagement Range of any enemy 
models can only Fall Back or Remain Stationary.
 
## REMAIN STATIONARY
If a unit Remains Stationary, none of its models can be moved 
for the rest of the phase.
## NORMAL MOVES
When a unit makes a Normal move, each model in that unit 
can move a distance in inches less than or equal to its Move (M) 
characteristic, but no model can be moved within Engagement 
Range of any enemy models (pg 7).
* Normal Move: Models move up to M".
* Cannot move within Engagement Range of any 
enemy models.

## ADVANCE MOVES
When a unit Advances, make an Advance roll for that unit 
by rolling one D6. Add the result in inches to the Move 
characteristic of each model in that unit until the end of the 
phase. Each model in that unit can then make an Advance 
move by moving a distance in inches less than or equal to this 
total, but no model can be moved within Engagement Range of 
enemy models. A unit cannot shoot or declare a charge in the 
same turn that it Advanced.
* Advance Move: Models move up to M+D6".
* Cannot move within Engagement Range of any 
enemy models.
* Units that Advance cannot shoot or charge this turn.

## FALL BACK MOVES 
When a unit Falls Back, each model in that unit can 
make a Fall Back move by moving a distance in inches 
less than or equal to its Move characteristic, and when 
doing so you can move it within Engagement Range 
of enemy models, provided it does not end that move 
within Engagement Range of any enemy models – if 
this is not possible, that unit cannot Fall Back.

A unit cannot shoot or declare a charge in the same 
turn that it Fell Back.

### Desperate Escape Tests
Unlike when making other types of move, models can 
move over enemy models when making a Fall Back 
move as if those enemy models were not there, but you 
must take a Desperate Escape test for each model that 
will do so (excluding models that are **Titanic** or can **Fly**) 
before any models in that unit are moved. In addition, if 
a unit is Battle-shocked when it is selected to Fall Back, 
you must take a Desperate Escape test for every model 
in that unit before any are moved.

Each time you take a Desperate Escape test for a model, 
roll one D6. For each roll of 1-2, one model from the 
unit that is Falling Back is destroyed (selected by you). 
The same model can only ever trigger one Desperate Escape test per phase.

* Fall Back Move: Models move up to M"
* Units that Fall Back cannot shoot or declare a 
charge in the same turn.
* Models can move over enemy models when Falling 
Back, but you must take Desperate Escape tests 
for them before they do so (excluding models that 
are Titanic or can Fly).
* If a Battle-shocked unit is selected to Fall Back, 
take a Desperate Escape test for every model in 
that unit.
* Desperate Escape Test: Roll one D6. On a 1-2, one 
model from that unit is destroyed.

## MOVING OVER TERRAIN
Warhammer 40,000 battlefields are strewn with a 
wide variety of obstacles, structures and detritus 
collectively known as terrain features (see 
pages 44-48). When a model makes any kind of 
move, it can be moved over a terrain feature but 
not through it (so models can’t move through a 
wall, for example, but can climb up or over it). 
A model can be moved over terrain features that 
are 2" or less in height as if they were not there. 
A model can be moved vertically in order to 
climb up or down any terrain features that are 
taller than this, counting the vertical distance up 
and/or down as part of its move. Models cannot 
end any kind of move mid-climb – if it is not 
possible to end the move as a result, that move 
cannot be made.
* Models can move freely over terrain 
features 2" or less in height.
* Models cannot move through terrain 
features taller than 2", but can climb up 
and down them

## FLYING
If a model can Fly, then when it makes a Normal, Advance or 
Fall Back move, it can be moved over enemy models as if they 
were not there, and can be moved within Engagement Range of 
enemy models when making such a move. Note this also means 
that Monster and Vehicle models that can Fly can be moved 
over other Monster and Vehicle models when making such a 
move. However, models that can Fly cannot end their move on 
top of any other models or within Engagement Range of any 
enemy models.

When a model that can Fly starts or ends a move on a terrain 
feature, instead of measuring the path it has moved across the 
battlefield, you instead measure its path ‘through the air’, as shown 
in the diagram below.

* Fly models can move over enemy 
models when they make a Normal, 
Advance or Fall Back move.
* Fly models that start or end a move 
on a terrain feature measure distance 
moved through the air when they make 
a Normal, Advance or Fall Back move.


# 2. REINFORCEMENTS
 Some units have a rule that allows them to start the battle in 
Reserves, such as Deep Strike (pg 39). Such units will arrive 
later in the battle and are known as Reserves units. Any 
Reserves units that have not been set up on the battlefield when 
the battle ends count as having been destroyed.
 In the Reinforcements step of your Movement phase, if you have 
any Reserves units in your army, you can select one or more of 
them and set them up on the battlefield, one at a time. Once all 
your Reserves units that you wish to set up this turn have been 
set up, your Movement phase ends and you progress to your 
Shooting phase. 
Details of how to set up Reserves units are described in the 
same rules that enabled the unit to be set up in Reserves. These 
rules will typically specify a distance away from all enemy 
models; whenever such a distance is specified, it always 
applies to the horizontal distance, even though 
normally you measure to and from the closest part 
of a model’s base. 

Reserves units always count as having made a 
Normal move in the turn they are set up on the 
battlefield, and so cannot move further during 
this phase. Otherwise, units set up in this way 
can act normally this turn (shoot, declare a 
charge, fight, etc.).

* **Reserves Unit**: A unit that starts 
the battle in a location other than 
the battlefield.
* Always count as having made a 
Normal move in the turn they are set 
up on the battlefield.
* Any specified distance from 
enemy models applies to 
horizontal distance.
* Any Reserves unit not set up on the 
battlefield by the end of the battle 
counts as destroyed

# TRANSPORTS
_Some units can carry others across the battlefield, providing their passengers with greater speed and protection as 
they are ferried to the front lines or towards vital objectives._

Some models have the Transport keyword. The 
following rules describe how units can embark 
within and disembark from such models, and how 
they are used to move these passengers across 
the battlefield. 

## TRANSPORT CAPACITY 
All **Transport** models have a transport capacity 
listed on their datasheet. This determines the type 
and maximum number of friendly models that can 
embark within them.

Units can start the battle embarked within a 
**Transport** model instead of being set up separately – declare which units are embarked within a 
**Transport** model before you set it up.

### FIRING DECK
_Some transports have firing hatches, ports or 
platforms from which embarked passengers 
can shoot._

Some Transport models have ‘Firing Deck x’ 
listed in their abilities. Each time such a model 
is selected to shoot in the Shooting phase, you 
can select up to ‘x’ models embarked within it. 
Then, for each of those embarked models, you 
can select one ranged weapon that embarked 
model is equipped with. Until that Transport 
model has resolved all of its attacks, it counts 
as being equipped with all of the weapons 
you selected in this way, in addition to its 
other weapons

* Firing Deck ‘x’: Each time this Transport 
shoots, select one weapon from up 
to ‘x’ models embarked within it; this 
Transport counts as being equipped 
with those weapons as well.

## EMBARK
If a unit makes a Normal, Advance or Fall Back 
move, and every model in that unit ends that move 
within 3" of a friendly Transport model, they can 
embark within it. A unit cannot embark if it has 
already disembarked from a Transport model in the 
same phase. Remove the unit from the battlefield 
and place it to one side – it is now embarked within 
that Transport model. Unless otherwise stated, units 
cannot do anything or be affected in any way while 
they are embarked.

*  A unit can embark within a friendly Transport 
if all of its models end a Normal, Advance or 
Fall Back move within 3" of that Transport.
* A unit cannot embark and disembark in the 
same phase.

## DISEMBARK 
If a unit from your army starts your Movement 
phase embarked within a Transport model, that unit 
can disembark in that phase.

When a unit disembarks from a Transport model, 
set it up on the battlefield so that it is wholly 
within 3" of that Transport model and not within 
Engagement Range of any enemy models. If, for any 
reason, a disembarking model cannot be set up, that 
model’s unit cannot disembark.

Units that disembark from a Transport model that 
either Remained Stationary this phase or has not 
yet made a Normal, Advance or Fall Back move this 
phase can then act normally (make a Normal move, 
Advance, shoot, declare a charge, fight, etc.) in the 
remainder of the turn. Such a disembarking unit 
cannot choose to Remain Stationary.

Units that disembark from a Transport model that 
made a Normal move this phase count as having 
made a Normal move themselves; they cannot move 
further during this phase. Such a unit also cannot 
declare a charge in the same turn, but can otherwise 
act normally in the remainder of the turn. 
Units cannot disembark from a Transport model 
that either Advanced or Fell Back this turn.

* Units that start your Movement phase 
embarked within a Transport can disembark 
this phase, provided their Transport has not 
Advanced or Fallen Back.
* If a unit disembarks before its Transport 
moves, it can act normally.
* If a unit disembarks after its Transport 
moves, it cannot move or charge this turn, but 
can otherwise act normally.
* Disembarking units must be set up wholly 
within 3" of their Transport and not within 
Engagement Range of any enemy models (or 
the unit cannot disembark).
* Units that disembark this turn cannot 
Remain Stationary.

## DESTROYED TRANSPORTS
If a Transport model is destroyed, any units 
embarked within that Transport model must 
immediately disembark (see opposite) before that 
Transport model is removed from the battlefield.

Units that disembark from a destroyed Transport 
model are not affected by that model’s Deadly 
Demise ability (pg 23). Instead, you must roll one D6 
for each disembarking model. For each roll of 1, that 
disembarking model’s unit suffers 1 mortal wound 
(pg 23). In addition, if a unit disembarks from a 
destroyed Transport model:

*  Until the start of its controlling player’s next 
Command phase, that unit is Battle-shocked.
* Until the end of the turn, that unit counts as 
having made a Normal move this turn, and cannot 
declare a charge this turn (pg 29). 
* If a Transport is destroyed, any embarked 
units must disembark.
* Roll one D6 for each model that disembarks: 
for each 1, that model’s unit suffers 1 
mortal wound.
* Until the start of its controlling player’s next 
Command phase, the disembarking unit 
is Battle-shocked.
* Until the end of the turn, the disembarking unit 
counts as having made a Normal move, and 
cannot declare a charge.

## Emergency Disembarkation
If a Transport model is destroyed and it is not 
possible to set up a disembarking unit wholly 
within 3" of that Transport model and not 
within Engagement Range of any enemy models, 
that unit must instead perform an Emergency 
Disembarkation. This is performed as described for 
disembarking from a destroyed Transport model, 
except that a unit that does so must be set up wholly 
within 6" of the destroyed Transport model (instead 
of wholly within 3") and not within Engagement 
Range of any enemy models, and when rolling for 
each disembarking model, that unit suffers 1 mortal 
wound for each roll of 1-3 (instead of for each roll 
of 1). If, for any reason, a disembarking model still 
cannot be set up, that model is destroyed.

* Units disembarking a destroyed Transport 
that cannot be set up wholly within 3" of it 
must perform an Emergency Disembarkation:
   * Must be set up wholly within 6" of it 
instead of wholly within 3".
   * Suffer 1 mortal wound for each roll of 1-3, 
instead of each roll of 1.
   * Any disembarking model that cannot be 
set up is destroyed.
