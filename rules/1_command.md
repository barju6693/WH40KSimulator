# COMMAND PHASE
Commanders gauge the flow of the battle, consolidating their objectives before making alterations to
their battle plans and devising new tactics and strategies with which to defeat the foe.

Your Command phase is split into
two steps. In the first; COMMAND, both players
gain 1 Command point (CP) and
you resolve any other Command
phase rules; in the second; BATTLE-SHOCK, you
test to see if any of your units
are Battle-shocked.

## GAINING COMMAND POINTS
Outside of the CP players gain at
the start of the Command phase,
each player can only gain a total of
1CP per battle round, regardless of
the source.


# 1. COMMAND
At the start of your Command phase, before doing anything
else, both players gain 1CP. Command points are a strategic
resource that you can spend during the battle to use Stratagems.
You can find out more about Stratagems on pages 41-42.
Then, if you have any other rules that need to be resolved in
the Command phase, you do so now before progressing to the
Battle-shock step.
■ Both players gain 1CP.
■ Resolve any other rules that occur in the Command phase.

# 2. BATTLE-SHOCK
In this step, you must take a Battle-shock test for each of your
units on the battlefield that is Below Half-strength (pg 12).
To do so, roll 2D6: if the result is greater than or equal to the
best Leadership characteristic in that unit, the test is passed;
otherwise, the test is failed and, until the start of your next
Command phase, that unit is Battle-shocked.
While a unit is Battle-shocked:
* The Objective Control characteristic of all of its models is 0.
* If it Falls Back, you must take a Desperate Escape test for
every model in that unit (pg 14).
* Its controlling player cannot use Stratagems to affect that unit.
Once you have taken Battle-shock tests for all of your units that
require them, your Command phase ends and you progress to
your Movement phase.
* Take a Battle-shock test for each unit from your army on
the battlefield that is Below Half-strength.
* Roll 2D6: if the result is greater than or equal to the unit’s
Leadership, the test is passed. Otherwise, the unit is
Battle-shocked until the start of your next Command phase.
* Battle-shocked units have an OC of 0 and their controlling
player cannot use Stratagems to affect them.
* Battle-shocked units must take Desperate Escape tests if
they Fall Back.

## STARTING STRENGTH
The number of models a unit contains when it is added
to your army is known as its Starting Strength.
BELOW HALF-STRENGTH
Some rules will refer to a unit being
Below Half-strength.
* If a unit has a Starting Strength of 1, then it is said
to be Below Half-strength while its remaining
number of wounds is less than half of its
Wounds characteristic.
* For any other unit, while the number of models in
that unit is less than half of its Starting Strength, that
unit is said to be Below Half-strength.

## DESTROYED
Throughout a battle, models will suffer damage and be
destroyed. When a model is destroyed, it is removed
from the battlefield. When every model in a unit has
been destroyed, that unit is destroyed.

## ATTACHED UNITS
Some Character units have the Leader ability (pg 39),
which lets them merge with other units (known as
Bodyguard units) to form an Attached unit.
The Starting Strength of an Attached unit is equal to
the combined Starting Strengths of all of its units (i.e.
the number of models in the Leader unit added to the
number of models in the Bodyguard unit). If either the
Leader unit or the Bodyguard unit in an Attached unit
is destroyed, the Starting Strength of the remaining unit
is changed to be equal to its original Starting Strength.

***Example**: A Primaris Captain (Starting Strength 1) is
attached to a unit of Intercessors (Starting Strength 5).
This Attached unit has a Starting Strength of 6. If all
the Intercessors are destroyed, the remaining Primaris
Captain would revert to having a Starting Strength
of 1.*

For the purposes of rules that are triggered when a unit
is destroyed, such rules are still triggered when one of
the individual units that made up an Attached unit is
destroyed (the Leader or the Bodyguard unit).

***Example**: If a rule awards you with 1VP each time an
enemy unit is destroyed, and you target an Attached
unit, you would gain 1VP if the Bodyguard unit is
destroyed and 1VP if the Leader unit is destroyed (for
a total of 2VP).*
