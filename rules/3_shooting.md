# SHOOTING PHASE
Guns thunder and shrapnel flies through the air. Bursts of muzzle flare and beams of las-fire illuminate 
the fog of war, and spent ammunition cartridges litter the battlefield.

Use the following sequence when a unit shoots.
 1. SELECT ELIGIBLE UNIT
 2. SELECT TARGETS
 3. MAKE RANGED ATTACKS
 4. REPEAT FOR NEXT ELIGIBLE UNIT


 In your Shooting phase, if you have one or more eligible units 
from your army on the battlefield, you can select those units, 
one at a time, and shoot with them. Each unit can only be 
selected to shoot once per phase. Once all of the units you 
selected have shot, progress to your Charge phase. 
A unit is eligible to shoot unless any of the following apply:
* That unit Advanced this turn.
* That unit Fell Back this turn.

## SELECT TARGETS
Each time a unit shoots, before any attacks are resolved, you 
must select the enemy units that will be the targets for all of 
the ranged weapons you wish its models to make attacks with. 
Each time you select a target for a model’s ranged weapon, you 
can only select an enemy unit as the target if at least one model 
in that unit is both within range of that weapon and visible to 
that attacking model (pg 8). An enemy model is within range of 
a weapon if the distance between it and the attacking model is 
equal to or less than that weapon’s Range characteristic. 

If a model has more than one ranged weapon, it can shoot all 
of them at the same target or it can shoot each of them at a 
different target, but it cannot split attacks from the same weapon 
across more than one target. Similarly, if a unit has more than 
one model, those models can shoot at the same or different 
targets. In any case, when you select a target unit you must 
declare which models will target that unit with which weapons 
before any attacks are resolved. If any of these weapons have 
more than one profile that you must choose between, you must 
also declare which profile is being used.

* Before a unit shoots, select the targets for all of its 
ranged weapons.
* At least one model in the target unit must be visible to 
the attacking model and within range of the weapon 
being used.
* Models with more than one ranged weapon can shoot 
them at the same or different targets, but models cannot 
split attacks from the same weapon across more than 
one target.
* Models in the same unit can shoot at the same or 
different targets.

## LONE OPERATIVE
Assassins and other covert agents are difficult to track and 
pinpoint in the swirling maelstrom of battle.

Unless part of an Attached unit (see Leader, page 39), this 
unit can only be selected as the target of a ranged attack if 
the attacking model is within 12".

## MAKE RANGED ATTACKS
The shooting unit’s models now make attacks using their ranged 
weapons. Each time a model shoots with a ranged weapon, 
it will make a number of attacks equal to the Attacks (A) 
characteristic in that weapon’s profile. You make one Hit roll for 
each attack being made (see Making Attacks, pages 21-23).

If you selected more than one target for your unit to shoot at, 
you must resolve all of the attacks against one target before 
moving on to the next target. If your unit is shooting more than 
one ranged weapon at a target, and those weapons have different 
profiles, then after you have resolved attacks with one of those 
weapons you must, if any other weapons with the same profile 
are also being shot at that unit, resolve those attacks before 
resolving any other attacks against the target.

Note that, provided at least one model in the target unit was 
visible to an attacking model and in range of that attacking 
model’s weapon when that target unit was selected, that 
weapon’s attacks can still be made, even if no models in the 
target unit remain visible to or in range of it when you come to 
resolve those attacks (for example, because models in the target 
unit have already been destroyed by attacks made with other 
weapons in the attacking model's unit).

* When a model shoots a weapon, it makes a number of 
attacks equal to that weapon’s Attacks characteristic.
* Resolve all attacks against one unit before resolving 
attacks against any other unit.
* Resolve all attacks made with the same weapon profile 
before resolving attacks with any other profile.
* If a weapon was in range and its target was visible when 
selected, that weapon’s attacks can always be made.

## Locked in Combat
A unit is not eligible to shoot while it is within Engagement 
Range of one or more enemy units. 
While an enemy unit is within Engagement Rage of one or more 
units from your army, you cannot select that enemy unit as a 
target of ranged weapons.

Monster and Vehicle units are exceptions to these rules, as 
described in the Big Guns Never Tire section (see right).
* Units cannot shoot while within Engagement Range of 
enemy units. 
* Units cannot shoot at targets within Engagement Range of 
friendly units.

## STEALTH
Some warriors are masters of disguise and concealment.

If every model in a unit has this ability, then each time 
a ranged attack is made against it, subtract 1 from that 
attack’s Hit roll.

## BIG GUNS NEVER TIRE
Monsters and war engines can 
dispense death from afar even as they 
trample the masses before them. 

Monster and Vehicle units are 
eligible to shoot in their controlling 
player’s Shooting phase even while 
they are within Engagement Range 
of one or more enemy units. Ranged 
weapons equipped by Monster 
and Vehicle units can target one 
or more of the enemy units they 
are within Engagement Range of, 
even if other friendly units are 
also within Engagement Range of 
the same enemy unit. Each time a 
Monster or Vehicle model makes a 
ranged attack, if its unit was within 
Engagement Range of one or more 
enemy units when it selected its 
targets, unless that attack is made 
with a Pistol (pg 25), subtract 1 
from that attack’s Hit roll.

You can select an enemy Monster 
or Vehicle unit within Engagement 
Range of one or more units from 
your army as a target of ranged 
weapons. Each time a model from 
your army makes a ranged attack 
against such a target, unless that 
attack is made with a Pistol, subtract 
1 from that attack’s Hit roll.

Designer’s Note: A unit that is 
within Engagement Range of an 
enemy Monster or Vehicle unit 
is still not eligible to shoot, and so 
cannot make ranged attacks against 
that Monster or Vehicle unit (unless 
that unit is eligible to shoot even 
while within Engagement Range of 
enemy units, e.g. it is itself a Monster 
or Vehicle unit, or its models are 
equipped with Pistols). Other units 
from your army that are eligible to 
shoot can, however, target and shoot 
that enemy Monster or Vehicle unit.

* Monsters and Vehicles 
can shoot, and be shot at, 
even while they are within 
Engagement Range of enemy 
units. Each time a ranged 
attack is made by or against 
such a unit, subtract 1 from 
that attack’s Hit roll (unless 
shooting with a Pistol).


# MAKING ATTACKS
Attacks are made using ranged or melee weapons. Attacks can be made one at a time or, in some cases, 
you can roll for multiple attacks together (see Fast Dice Rolling, page 24).

Use the following sequence to make attacks one at a time.
 1. HIT ROLL
 2. WOUND ROLL
 3. ALLOCATE ATTACK
 4. SAVING THROW
 5. INFLICT DAMAGE

## 1. HIT ROLL
 When a model makes an attack, make one Hit roll for that 
attack by rolling one D6. If the result of the Hit roll is greater 
than or equal to the attack’s Ballistic Skill (BS) characteristic (if 
the attack is being made with a ranged weapon) or its Weapon 
Skill (WS) characteristic (if the attack is being made with a 
melee weapon), then that Hit roll is successful and scores one 
hit against the target unit. Otherwise, the attack fails and the 
attack sequence ends. 
An unmodified Hit roll of 6 is called a Critical Hit and is always 
successful. An unmodified Hit roll of 1 always fails. A Hit roll 
can never be modified by more than -1 or +1.
 ■ Hit Roll (Ranged Attack): A hit is scored if the D6 result 
equals or exceeds that attack’s BS.
 ■ Hit Roll (Melee Attack): A hit is scored if the D6 result 
equals or exceeds that attack’s WS.
 ■Critical Hit: Unmodified Hit roll of 6. Always successful.
 ■An unmodified Hit roll of 1 always fails.
 ■ A Hit roll can never be modified by more than -1 or +1.
 
## 2. WOUND ROLL
 Each time an attack scores a hit against a target unit, make a 
Wound roll for that attack by rolling one D6 to see if that attack 
successfully wounds the target unit. The result required is 
determined by comparing the attack’s Strength (S) characteristic 
with the target’s Toughness (T) characteristic, as shown below. 
 
WOUND ROLL

| ATTACK’S STRENGTH VS TARGET’S TOUGHNESS | D6 RESULT REQUIRED |
|---|--------------------|
|Strength is TWICE (or more than twice) the Toughness.| 2+                 |
|Strength is GREATER than the Toughness.| 3+                 |
|Strength is EQUAL to the Toughness.                      | 4+                 |
|Strength is HALF (or less than half) the Toughness.| 5+                 |

If the result of the Wound roll is greater than or equal to the 
required number shown in the table opposite, then that Wound 
roll is successful and scores one wound against the target unit. 
Otherwise, the attack fails and the attack sequence ends. 
An unmodified Wound roll of 6 is called a Critical Wound and 
is always successful. An unmodified Wound roll of 1 always 
fails. A Wound roll can never be modified by more than -1 
or +1.
* Critical Wound: Unmodified Wound roll of 6. Always successful.
* An unmodified Wound roll of 1 always fails.
* A Wound roll can never be modified by more than -1 or +1.

## 3. ALLOCATE ATTACK
If an attack successfully wounds the target unit, the player 
controlling the target unit allocates that attack to one model in 
the target unit, as follows.

If a model in the target unit has already lost one or more 
wounds, or has already had attacks allocated to it this phase, 
that attack must be allocated to that model. Otherwise, that 
attack can be allocated to any model in the target unit. Note 
that it does not matter if that model is visible to or within 
range/Engagement Range of the attacking model.
* If a model in the target unit has already lost any wounds or 
had other attacks allocated to it this phase, the attack must 
be allocated to that model.

## 4. SAVING THROW
The player controlling the target unit then makes one saving 
throw. By default, this will be an armour saving throw using 
their model’s Save (Sv) characteristic, but some models have 
invulnerable saves that can be used instead (see right). To make 
an armour saving throw, roll one D6, then modify the result by 
the Armour Penetration (AP) characteristic of the attack. For 
example, if the attack has an AP of -1, then 1 is subtracted from 
the saving throw.

If the result is greater than or equal to the Save characteristic of 
the model the attack was allocated to, then that saving throw is 
successful and the attack sequence ends. Otherwise, that saving 
throw fails and that model suffers damage (pg 23).

An unmodified saving throw of 1 always fails. A saving throw 
can never be improved by more than +1. 
* Saving Throw: Roll one D6 and modify by the attack’s AP. If 
the result is less than the Save of the model being rolled for, 
the saving throw is failed and that model suffers damage. 
Otherwise, that attack is saved.
* An unmodified saving throw of 1 always fails.
* A saving throw can never be improved by more than +1.

### INVULNERABLE SAVES
Whether shielded by force fields, 
enveloped in mystical energies or 
simply possessed of preternatural 
senses and lightning-fast reflexes, 
some warriors are protected by more 
than mere physical armour. 
Some models have an invulnerable 
save listed on their datasheet. Each 
time an attack is allocated to a 
model with an invulnerable save, 
the controlling player must choose 
to use either that model’s Save 
characteristic or its invulnerable 
save, but not both. If a model has 
more than one invulnerable save, it 
can only use one of them – choose 
which it will use.

Unlike armour saving throws (which 
use a model’s Save characteristic), 
invulnerable saving throws are never 
modified by an attack’s Armour 
Penetration characteristic, but 
otherwise follow the normal rules 
for saving throws.

* Invulnerable Save: Never 
modified by an attack’s AP.
* The controlling player can 
choose to use either a 
model’s invulnerable save or 
its Save characteristic.


## 5. INFLICT DAMAGE
The damage inflicted is equal to the Damage (D) characteristic 
of the attack. A model loses one wound for each point of 
damage it suffers. If a model’s wounds are reduced to 0 or less, 
it is destroyed and removed from play. If a model loses several 
wounds from an attack and is destroyed, any excess damage 
inflicted by that attack is lost and has no effect.

* A model loses a number of wounds equal to the attack’s 
Damage characteristic.
* If a model is destroyed by an attack, any excess damage 
inflicted by that attack is lost.

### FEEL NO PAIN
Some warriors refuse to be laid low, even by what should be 
fatal wounds.

Some models have ‘Feel No Pain x+’ listed in their abilities. 
Each time a model with this ability suffers damage and so 
would lose a wound (including wounds lost due to mortal 
wounds), roll one D6: if the result is greater than or equal 
to the number denoted by ‘x’, that wound is ignored and is 
not lost. If a model has more than one Feel No Pain ability, 
you can only use one of those abilities each time that model 
suffers damage and so would lose a wound. 

* Feel No Pain x+: Each time this model would lose a 
wound, roll one D6: if the result equals or exceeds ‘x’, 
that wound is not lost.

### DEADLY DEMISE
From detonating ammo stores to corrosive innards or 
frenzied death throes, some targets are deadly even in defeat.

Some models have ‘Deadly Demise x’ listed in their 
abilities. When such a model is destroyed, roll one 
D6 before removing it from play (if such a model is a 
Transport, roll before any embarked models disembark). 
On a 6, each unit within 6" of that model suffers a number 
of mortal wounds denoted by ‘x’ (if this is a random 
number, roll separately for each unit within 6"). 
 
_Example: A Transport model with the Deadly Demise D3 
ability is destroyed. Before any models disembark and 
before removing it from play, its controlling player rolls 
one D6, getting a 6. There are three units within 6" of that 
destroyed model, so its controlling player rolls one D3 for 
each of them, inflicting mortal wounds accordingly._ 

* Deadly Demise x: When this model is destroyed, 
roll one D6. On a 6, each unit within 6" suffers 
‘x’ mortal wounds.

###  MORTAL WOUNDS
Some attacks are so powerful that no 
armour or force field can withstand 
their fury. 

Some attacks inflict mortal wounds. 
Each mortal wound inflicts one 
point of damage on the target unit, 
and they are always applied one 
at a time. Do not make a Wound 
roll or saving throw (including 
invulnerable saving throws) against 
a mortal wound – just allocate it 
as you would any other attack and 
inflict damage to a model in the 
target unit as described on the right.
 Unlike damage inflicted by normal 
attacks, excess damage from mortal 
wounds is not lost if the damage 
can be allocated to another model. 
Instead, keep allocating damage to 
another model in the target unit 
until either all the damage has 
been allocated or the target unit 
is destroyed. 

If, when a unit is selected to shoot or 
fight, one or more of its attacks can 
inflict mortal wounds on the target, 
resolve any normal damage inflicted 
by the attacking unit’s attacks on that 
target before inflicting any mortal 
wounds on that target. If an attack 
inflicts mortal wounds in addition to 
any normal damage, but the normal 
damage is subsequently saved, the 
target unit still suffers those mortal 
wounds, as described above

* Each mortal wound inflicted 
on a unit causes one model in 
that unit to lose one wound.
* No saving throws can be 
made against mortal wounds.
* Mortal wounds inflicted by 
attacks always apply after 
any normal damage, even if 
that damage was saved.
