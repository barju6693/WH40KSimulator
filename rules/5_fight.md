# FIGHT
When you select a unit to fight, it first Piles In, then its models make melee attacks, then the unit Consolidates.

Use the following sequence when a unit fights.
1. PILE IN
2. MAKE MELEE ATTACKS
Select weapon
Select targets
Make attacks
3. CONSOLIDATE

---

## 1. PILE IN
When a unit Piles In, you can move each model in that unit 
that is not already in base-to-base contact with an enemy model 
up to 3" – this is a Pile-in move. For a Pile In to be possible, 
a unit must be able to end these moves within Engagement 
Range of one or more enemy units and in Unit Coherency. 
If these conditions cannot be met, no models in the unit can 
make Pile-in moves this phase and you progress to making 
melee attacks with that unit. Otherwise, the unit can make 
Pile-in moves. 

Each time a model makes a Pile-in move, it must end that 
move closer to the closest enemy model. If it can also end that 
move in base-to-base contact with one or more enemy models 
while still satisfying all of the conditions above, it must do so. 
The controlling player chooses the order in which to move 
their models.
* Pile-in Move: Up to 3".
* Every model that moves must end closer to the closest 
enemy model, and in base-to-base contact with an enemy 
model if possible. The unit must end in Unit Coherency and 
within Engagement Range of at least one enemy unit (or no 
models can Pile In)

## 2. MAKE MELEE ATTACKS
When a unit makes its melee attacks, before resolving those 
attacks you must first determine which models can fight, then 
select which melee weapon each of those models will make 
attacks with, then select the targets for those attacks.

### WHICH MODELS FIGHT
When a unit makes its melee attacks, only models in that unit 
that are either within Engagement Range of an enemy unit, or 
in base-to-base contact with another model from their own 
unit that is itself in base-to-base contact with an enemy unit, 
can fight.
* A model can fight if it is within Engagement Range of an 
enemy unit.
* A model can fight if it is in base-to-base contact 
with another model from its own unit that is itself in 
base-to-base contact with an enemy unit.

### SELECT WEAPON
When a model fights, it must do so using a melee weapon it 
is equipped with. The weapons a model is equipped with are 
described on its datasheet. If a model has more than one melee 
weapon, it can only use one of them to make attacks with each 
time it fights, so you must now declare which it will use before 
resolving any of its attacks.

If the selected weapon has more than one profile to choose 
between, a model can only use one of them to make attacks with 
each time it fights, so you must also declare which profile it will 
use before resolving any of its attacks.
When a model fights, it will make a number of melee attacks 
determined by the Attacks (A) characteristic of the melee 
weapon it is using. 
* Each model that can fight does so using one of its 
melee weapons.
* Each model makes a number of attacks equal to the Attacks 
characteristic of its selected weapon.

### SELECT TARGETS
Before you resolve any melee attacks, you must first select the 
enemy units that will be the targets for all of those attacks. In 
order to select an enemy unit as the target of a melee attack, the 
attacking model must be either within Engagement Range of 
that enemy unit, or in base-to-base contact with another model 
in its own unit that is itself in base-to-base contact with that 
enemy unit.

If the melee weapon a model is using to fight with can make 
more than one attack, those attacks can all be made against 
the same target, or they can be split between different targets. 
Similarly, if a unit has more than one model, each model can 
make its attacks at the same, or different, targets. In either case, 
declare which attacks will target which units before any attacks 
are resolved.

If there are no eligible targets (because there are no enemy units 
within Engagement Range, for example) then that unit cannot 
make melee attacks this phase, but it can still Consolidate 
(pg 35).
* Select targets for all attacks before any are resolved.
* Attacking model must either be within Engagement Range 
of an enemy unit to target it, or in base-to-base contact 
with another model in its unit that is itself in base-to-base 
contact with that enemy unit.

### MAKE ATTACKS
Melee attacks follow the same attack sequence as ranged attacks 
(see Making Attacks, pages 21-23), and you make one Hit roll 
for each attack being made.

If more than one enemy unit has been targeted by an attacking 
unit’s melee attacks, resolve all of the attacks against one target 
before moving onto the next. 

If your unit is making attacks with more than one melee weapon 
against a unit, and those weapons have different profiles, then 
after you have resolved an attack with one of those weapons, if 
any other weapons with the same profile are also being used to 
make attacks against that unit, you must resolve those attacks 
before resolving any other attacks against the target. 

Note that all of the attacks you have declared targets for are 
always resolved against the target units, even if, when you come 
to resolve an attack, no models in the target unit of that attack
remain within Engagement Range of the attacking model’s unit 
(because of models being destroyed as the result of other attacks 
made by the attacking model’s unit, for example).
* Resolve all attacks against one unit before moving onto 
the next. 
* Resolve all attacks with the same weapon profile before 
resolving any made with a different weapon profile.
* All attacks declared against a target unit are resolved, even 
if no models in that unit remain within Engagement Range.

## 3. CONSOLIDATE
After a unit has finished making all of its melee attacks, it 
Consolidates. Each time a unit Consolidates, you can move each 
model in that unit that is not already in base-to-base contact 
with an enemy model up to 3" – this is a Consolidation move. 
For a Consolidation to be possible, a unit must be able to end 
these moves within Engagement Range of one or more enemy 
units and in Unit Coherency. If these conditions cannot be met, 
then each model in that unit can instead make a Consolidation 
move towards the closest objective marker, but only if, after 
doing so, that unit is within range of that objective marker and 
in Unit Coherency. If these conditions also cannot be met, no 
models in the unit can make Consolidation moves this phase 
and that unit’s fight ends. 

If a unit can end its Consolidation within Engagement Range 
of one or more enemy units, then each time one of its models 
makes a Consolidation move, it must end that move closer 
to the closest enemy model. If it can also end that move in 
base-to-base contact with one or more enemy models while 
still satisfying all of the conditions above, it must do so. 
The controlling player chooses the order in which to move 
their models.
* Consolidation Move: Up to 3".
* Every model that moves must end closer to the closest 
enemy model, and in base-to-base contact with an enemy 
model if possible. The unit must end in Unit Coherency 
and within Engagement Range of at least one enemy unit 
if possible.
* If the above is not possible, each model can move towards 
the closest objective marker, but this must result in the 
unit being within range of it and in Unit Coherency.
* If the above is also not possible, no models can Consolidate.
