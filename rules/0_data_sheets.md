# DATASHEETS
Each unit has a datasheet that lists the characteristics, wargear, abilities and keywords of its models. 
This section presents a summary of these elements and how they relate to playing the game.

## 1 DATASHEET NAME
Here you will find the name of the unit.

## 2 PROFILES
These contain the following characteristics 
that tell you how mighty the models in the 
unit are:

**Move (M)**: This is the speed at which a 
model moves across the battlefield. If a 
model has a Move of ‘-’ it is unable to move 
at all.

**Toughness (T)**: This reflects the model’s 
resilience against physical harm.
**Save (Sv)**: This indicates the protection a 
model’s armour gives them.

**Wounds (W)**: Wounds represent how 
much damage a model can sustain before 
it succumbs to its injuries. If a model’s 
Wounds characteristic is reduced to 0, that 
model is destroyed.

**Leadership (Ld)**: This reveals how 
courageous, determined or self-controlled a 
model is. The lower this number, the better 
a model’s Leadership is.

**Objective Control (OC)**: This shows how 
effectively a model can exert control over 
an objective on the battlefield. 

## 3 ABILITIES
Many units have special abilities and rules 
that may apply during the game, from Core 
Rules shared by many units to bespoke 
Psychic abilities and invulnerable saves. 
These will be described here, along with any 
rules that apply when larger models such as 
vehicles have suffered sufficient damage.
Some abilities are bestowed by items 
of wargear that models in a unit can be 
equipped with, and are known as Wargear 
abilities. These only apply while a model in 
the unit is equipped with the relevant item 
of wargear.

## 4 WEAPONS
Weapons are described with the 
following characteristics:

**Range**: How far the weapon can shoot. 
Weapons with a range of ‘Melee’ are 
melee weapons and can only be used 
in close combat. All other weapons are 
ranged weapons.

**Attacks (A)**: This tells you how many attacks 
are made each time that weapon is used. 

**Weapon Skill (WS)**: This reflects the bearer’s 
skill in wielding the relevant melee weapon.

**Ballistic Skill (BS)**: This shows how accurate 
the bearer is when shooting with the 
relevant ranged weapon.

**Strength (S)**: How likely the weapon is to 
wound a foe.

**Armour Penetration (AP)**: This represents 
the weapon’s ability to cut through the 
target’s defences.

**Damage (D)**: The amount of damage 
inflicted by a successful wound.

## 5 KEYWORDS
Datasheets have a list of keywords, 
separated into Faction keywords and other 
keywords. The former are used when 
deciding which models to include in your 
army, but otherwise both sets of keywords 
are functionally the same.

## 6 UNIT COMPOSITION 
AND OTHER RULES
This section details the number and types 
of models in the unit, and the default 
weapons and wargear those models are 
equipped with. It may also describe other 
interactions, such as how units with the 
Leader ability can attach to other units, and 
passenger restrictions that may apply to 
Transport models.

## 7 WARGEAR OPTIONS
Some datasheets have a bullet-pointed 
list of wargear options. When you include 
such a unit in your army, you can use these 
options to change the weapons and other 
wargear of models in the unit. The order 
you use these options in does not matter, 
but each can only be used once.

## LEADERSHIP TESTS
If a rule requires you to take a 
Leadership test for a unit, roll 2D6: 
if the total is greater than or equal 
to the best Leadership characteristic 
in that unit, that test is passed. 
Otherwise, it is failed. 

## RANDOM CHARACTERISTICS
Some characteristics are a random 
value instead of a number. 
For example, a model’s Move 
characteristic might be 2D6", or 
a weapon’s Attacks characteristic 
might be D6. When a unit with 
a random Move characteristic is 
selected to move, determine the 
entire unit’s move distance by 
rolling the indicated number of 
dice. For all other characteristics, 
roll to determine the value on 
an individual, per-model or 
per-weapon basis each time that 
characteristic is required. 

## AURA ABILITIES
Some abilities affect multiple models 
or units in a given range. These 
are known as Aura abilities and 
are tagged with the word ‘Aura’. A 
model with an Aura ability is always 
within range of its own Aura ability. 
A unit can be affected by more than 
one Aura ability at a time, but if 
a unit is within range of the same 
Aura ability more than once, that 
Aura ability only applies to that 
unit once.

## PSYCHIC WEAPONS AND ABILITIES
Some weapons and abilities can only 
be used by **Psykers**. Such weapons 
and abilities are tagged with the 
word ‘Psychic’. If a Psychic weapon 
or ability causes any unit to suffer 
one or more wounds, each of those 
wounds is considered to have been 
inflicted by a Psychic Attack.
