# THE BATTLE ROUND
Minute by bloody minute the battle grinds on, from the opening volleys of shots through furious
offensives and desperate counter-attacks, into the last dying moments when victory hangs by a thread.
Warhammer 40,000 is played in a series of battle rounds. In each battle round, both players have a turn. The
same player always takes the first turn in each battle round – the mission you are playing will tell you which
player this is. Each turn consists of a series of phases, which must be resolved in the following order.

## 1. COMMAND PHASE
Both players muster strategic resources, then you test your
units’ battle readiness.
## 2. MOVEMENT PHASE
Your units manoeuvre across the battlefield and
reinforcements enter the fray.
## 3. SHOOTING PHASE
Your units fire their ranged weapons at the foe.
## 4. CHARGE PHASE
Your units charge forward to battle at close quarters.
## 5. FIGHT PHASE
Both players’ units pile in and attack with melee weapons.

Once a player’s turn has ended, their opponent then starts their turn. Once both players
have completed a turn, the battle round has been completed and the next one begins,
and so on, until the battle ends.
